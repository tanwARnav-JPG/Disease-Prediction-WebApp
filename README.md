# 🩺 Multi-Disease Prediction System

A **Machine Learning-based web application** designed to predict multiple diseases — **Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, Breast Cancer, and Lung Cancer** — using clinical data.  
This project leverages **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** and **Logistic Regression** models to provide accurate and interpretable health predictions through a simple **Streamlit** interface.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Multi-Disease Prediction System** is developed to assist in the early detection of major chronic diseases by analyzing patient health data.  
Traditional diagnostic methods can be expensive, time-consuming, and inaccessible to many patients.  
This system uses **machine learning algorithms** to deliver quick, cost-effective, and reliable predictions that can support medical professionals in preliminary screening.
